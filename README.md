## Security policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This project follows strict industry-standard security from the start. Violations require full rebuild, not patches.

1. **No hardcoded credentials.** All secrets in `.env.local` (gitignored) or platform env vars
2. **`.env*` files are forbidden in git.** Pre-commit hook + CI block them
3. **RLS is mandatory** on every Supabase table. No exceptions
4. **Service-role key is server-only.** Never imported into client components
5. **Webhook signatures are verified** before any DB write
6. **CSP, HSTS, frame-deny** set in `next.config.js` and enforced by Cloudflare in production
7. **Branch protection on `main`.** No direct pushes. PRs require passing CI + review
8. **Audit log writes** on every config change. Immutable, no UPDATE or DELETE policy

If a credential leaks: rotate immediately, audit logs, do NOT patch in place. Treat the project as compromised and follow the incident runbook.

## Commission engine

Core logic in `src/lib/mlm/commission-calculator.ts`. Pure function, no DB calls. Tested against the PDF worked examples as canonical fixtures.

Run the tests to see assertions matching every numeric example from the comp plan:

```bash
npm test
```

Expected output: all tests pass on numbers including:

- 30ml package → Kes 800 / 360 / 200 / 120 / 80 / 40 / 40 across levels 1–7 (total Kes 1,640 = 41%)
- 50ml package → Kes 1,440 / 648 / 360 / 216 / 144 / 72 / 72 (total Kes 2,952 = 41%)
- Bronze month 1 example → Kes 8,400 gross, Kes 3,900 net after starter pack
- Gold active month example → Kes 67,000 gross
- Gold performance bonus → 2% × Kes 50,000 excess = Kes 1,000

---

## Money handling

- **Storage:** BigInt minor units (cents). 1 KES = 100 cents
- **Rates:** Integer basis points. 20% = 2000bp. 1.5% = 150bp
- **Display:** Convert at the edge using `formatKes()`. Never display raw bigints
- **Database columns:** `BIGINT NOT NULL` ending in `_minor`. CHECK constraints reject negatives where appropriate
- **Floats are forbidden** in any commission, salary, or payout calculation

---

## Database schema

See `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`. 22 tables in 9 domains:

1. Auth and profiles (with `user_role` enum)
2. Catalog (products, variants, bundles, bundle items)
3. Addresses and orders (with `order_kind` enum separating retail / signup / restock)
4. MLM core (distributors + closure-table tree capped at depth 7)
5. Config tables (commission rates, ranks, salary tiers, starter packages) with versioning via `effective_from / effective_until`
6. Commission ledger, monthly salaries, rank-up bonuses, payouts
7. GSV snapshots for fast monthly close
8. Audit log (append-only via RLS, superadmin reads only)
9. RLS policies on every table
